Windows Vista is Microsoft’s PC operating system that followed Windows XP and preceded Windows 7. It is known for its dramatically augmented visual display and stringent security advancements. Key features include the Windows Aero display (which is an acronym for “advanced, energetic, reflective and open”), instant search via Explorer windows, Windows Sidebar and advanced parental controls.

## How to Reset a Windows Vista Password

* Insert your Windows Vista installation DVD into your optical drive and then restart your computer.
* Wait for the Install Windows screen to appear and then press Next.
* Select Repair your computer, located near the bottom of the window, above the Microsoft copyright notice.
* Once your Windows Vista installation is found, look for the drive letter noted in the Location column.
* From the Operating System list, of probably just one entry, highlight Windows Vista and then select Next.
* Choose Command Prompt from the list of recovery tools.
* In Command Prompt, type the following two commands, in this order, pressing Enter after each line to execute it:
* Remove your Windows Vista disc and restart the computer.
* On the Windows Vista login screen, select the little pie-shaped icon at the bottom-left corner.
* Now that Command Prompt is open, use the net user command as demonstrated below but replace myuser with your username and newpassword with the password you want to set
* Once you see the "command completed successfully" message, close Command Prompt and log in with your new password!
* Now that you're logged back in, create a Windows Vista password reset disk. Once you have one of these, you'll never need to worry about forgetting your password or hacking your way back in like this again.
* Lastly, we recommend reversing the changes you made to make this trick work. You don't have to, but if you don't, you'll no longer have access to Vista's accessibility features at the login screen. To undo everything, except for your password—which will keep working as you've reset it in Step 10, repeat Steps 1 through 6 exactly as outlined above.
* Answer Yes when asked to confirm the overwriting of utilman.exe.
